Welcome to Kython's documentation!
==================================

Kython is a Python 3.9+ interpreter for the JVM, written in Kotlin.

What is Kython
--------------

Kython is a bytecode interpreter, which interprets CPython-compatible bytecode and executes it. It
creates JVM boxed wrappers for Python objects for a seamless Python environment.

What is not Kython
------------------

Kython is not "Python on the JVM" - your Python code is not translated to JVM bytecode outside of
certain optimisations.
